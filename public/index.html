              A personal site to share my thoughts and musings on topics such as equality, religion,
              politics and the other frustrations of everyday life. A place for a grumpy old man to
              sound off.

              The very act of writing forces you to research better, to test your views, to
              understand why things aren't black and white or simple to fix. Life is just messy. We
              could have a better messy though!

            <div class="text-primary-600 mx-8 my-4 text-base">
              The views are my own. I'm not trying to convert anyone or claim my opinions are the
              correct ones. I just wake up, every day, angry at the selfishness, the
              <span class="italic">what's in it for me</span> attitude and the short term thinking
              of our global and national politicians. We deserve better. We lack decent role models.

            <div class="text-primary-600 mx-8 my-4 text-base">
              Despite these views I acknowledge that life has got better. Education standards,
              poverty levels, global health have all improved. However, is my generation (child of
              the fifties) going to leave the world a better place? I fear not for our grandchildren
