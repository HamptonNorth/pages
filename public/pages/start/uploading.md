# Uploading
Not everyone will be able to or need to set up a FTP link to their blogging/documentation server. This illustrates a simple way to add a new page created on your own PC (or Mac or Linux workstation). The screen shots show creation of the markdown using Typora though you can use any text editor that's convenient.

The first step is to upload any images. You'll want to reference them in your markdown content and the upload will give you 'copy and paste' markdown for each image. 

<img title="Upload an image" alt="Upload an image" src="/media/start/upload-ui.png" style="width: 360px; ">



Continue typing your content, and when complete upload the markdown file itself. In this case `uploading2.md`.

<img title="Creating content using Typora" alt="Creating content using Typora" src="/media/start/typora-md-create.png" style="width: 600px; ">


Don't worry about front matter formats, the upload will detect you have no front matter and add a valid front matter section at the beginning of your markdown ready for editing.

### After uploading

You will now be able to see your new content. The title and summary will show as *(needs editing)*. Click the edit link, edit your front matter and then save.

When it all looks correct you can the click the publish link to make it visible to all user. 

> Note only signed in users with `role=admin` are able to `view|edit|publish` and to upload files and images.
