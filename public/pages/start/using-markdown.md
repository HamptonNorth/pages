# Using mardown

Markdown is a lightweight way to format text using symbols that look like what they represent. It’s widely used for documentation, README files, and notes because it stays readable even as plain text.

Here is a summary of the most common syntax.

```markdown

# Markdown Guide for Beginners

This is a quick reference guide to get you started with Markdown.

## 1. Headers
Use the `#` symbol followed by a space. The more hashes you use, the smaller the header.

# Level 1 Header (Title)
## Level 2 Header (Section)
### Level 3 Header (Sub-section)

---

## 2. Text Emphasis
Make your words stand out with simple punctuation.

* *Italic:* Wrap text in single asterisks `*text*` or underscores `_text_`.
* **Bold:** Wrap text in double asterisks `**text**` or underscores `__text__`.
* ~~Strikethrough:~~ Use double tildes `~~text~~`.

---

## 3. Lists
Organize your thoughts easily.

**Unordered List:**
* Item A
* Item B
  * Sub-item (Indent with two spaces)

**Ordered List:**
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## 4. Links and Images
Adding media and external resources is straightforward.

* **Link:** [Click here to visit Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)
* **Image:** ![Alt text for the image](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-workspace-assets/uploads/7uffzv9dk4sn-3KCIF2Mu1BRcJbbDf8yYFa-ce16c52d9ad0da0d6818e6fcb3ddbfed-SolutionsAI_TemplateGeminiPromoTile_GeminiSpark_Logo.svg)

## 5. Blockquotes and Code
Perfect for highlighting citations or technical snippets.

> This is a blockquote. Use the `>` symbol at the start of the line to highlight a specific quote or note.

To show **inline code**, use backticks: `print("Hello World")`.

To show a **code block**, use three backticks above and below:

````html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    This is a very simple HTML page.
  </body>
</html>

````

There are several examples of hozontal rules used to divide the page up. These are 3 dashes using  `---` on their own line.
