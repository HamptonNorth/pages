#### The regional divide in UK. 
House prices. Not possible to migrate N > S. Demand in SE pushes prices ever higher. Infrastructure differences. Railway, roads, airports, arts. The case for devolved power. Does it work or just increase cost. German post war imposition of city size. Compare UK to France/Germany. Did london gov impose different furlough % in NW??

#### Income inequality. 
Power of super billionaires. Must $ to Trump campaign and payback. Keeping taxes low does not benefit others - no trickle down

#### Access to truth. 
Daily Mail & Euro army. Reliable (Economist/BBC) SLAPs. Internet take down notices. Social media, Youtube TikTok etc. QUANON Flat earthers, anti vaccinations - in position of power.

#### Value scientists, teachers and engineers. 
Not solicitors, accountants and bankers. Why is someone who cares for the elderly paid so little whereas someone who design tax avoidance schemes is highly paid. We need a well educated, numerate and compassionate society

#### UK planning issues. 
Size of parking bays. Conflict of conservation are versus energy efficiency. Ratio of parking to office space
Last year, the average length of light-duty passenger vehicles in the US hit 5.24 meters, with the average width 1.96 meters. The EU average car length is now 4.53 meters. Due to their sheer size, US vehicles don't work well in European urban areas. Narrower roads aside, UK standard parking bays have been 4.8 meters by 2.4 meters for a long time. Now with the increase in car sizes in general, the UK's Institution of Structural Engineers issued car park design guidance in 2023, increasing its recommendation for bay size to 5 meters by 2.6 meters—dimensions that would still be insufficient for the average US car.

#### Quality of our role models. 
Role models. Politician's expense, Clergy and kiddy fiddling, leaving government and cushy jobs for the lads etc, behaviour of super rich. Attitude to football referees compared to hockey umpires or rugby referees. (Trump has famously survived one impeachment, two divorces, six bankruptcies, twenty-six accusations of sexual misconduct, and an estimated four thousand lawsuits)

#### Religion
Separation of religion and state (Education Bishops in house of Lords)
