## 1. MarkText
**MarkText** is a completely free, open-source editor that provides a seamless writing experience. It uses a "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) interface, hiding the Markdown syntax as you type to keep the document clean.

* **Key Feature:** Real-time preview that feels like a standard word processor.
* **GFM Support:** High (includes tables, task lists, and emojis).

## 3. Typora

* **Cost:** Small one-time fee (~£12)
